Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Why are you not developing my feature request?
----------------------------------------------

Kanboard is an open source project with limited resources.

- Developing and maintaining a software takes a lot of time.
- Do not under estimate the complexity of introducing changes.
- This is a free and open source project, no one owes you anything.
- If you miss something, contribute to the project.
- Do not expect anyone to work for free.
- People are not going to spend days and weeks of their time to develop a feature just for you.
- No one manages projects in the same way, this is not possible to satisfy the workflow of everyone.
- The number of features is voluntarily limited. Nobody likes bloatware.
- Improving existing features is more important than adding new ones.

Why do you close inactive issues automatically?
-----------------------------------------------

- If nobody manifested any interest to develop your feature request, then there is no point of keeping it open.
- Keeping issues open indefinitely will not get fixed by itself.
- Stale issues create more noise.

Why did you close my question on the bug tracker?
-------------------------------------------------

- The bug tracker should be reserved only for bug reports.
- Bug triage takes a lot of time.
- If you have a question or if you need help, go to the `forum <https://github.com/kanboard/forum/issues>`_.
