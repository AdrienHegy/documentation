Pull-requests are always welcome. However, to be accepted you have to
follow those directives:

-  **Test your changes!** Do not introduce regressions.
-  Before doing any large changes, open a new ticket to start a discussion.
-  If you want to add a new feature, respect the philosophy behind
   Kanboard. **We focus on simplicity**, we donâ€™t want to have a bloated
   software.
-  The same apply for the user interface, **simplicity and efficiency**.
-  Send only one pull-request for each feature or bug fix.
-  A smaller pull-request is easier to review and it will be merged faster.
-  Make sure the unit tests pass.
-  Respect the coding standards.
-  Write maintainable code, avoid code duplication, use good practices.
-  Avoid introducing new dependencies.
